<h1 style="text-align: center;">Buchingae - A Rule Language for The Web</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">Written by Minsu Jang(minsu@etri.re.kr)<br>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Buchingae is a simple web-oriented rule language. By "web-oriented",
we mean that you can directly refer to URI resources such as web
ontology elements or RDF resources when writing rules. Buchingae is a
language appropriate for specifying production rules, but is not
limited to production rules as it has procedural attachment feature
that enables writing ECA rules.</p>
<p> We have not attempted to characterize computational properties of
this language, since Buchingae is developed as a useful <em>tool</em>
for reasoning over web ontologies. We tried to make as many a valuable
features that might be useful for web ontology reasoning as possible
available in Buchingae, and we think we're going well at it.</p>
<p>Here're some important features of Buchingae:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Native support for URI reference</li>
  <li>Every knowledge element is assigned a URI</li>
  <li>Simple syntax</li>
  <li>Support for object oriented knowledge representation</li>
  <li>Support for strong negation &amp; weak negation at the same time</li>
  <li>Easy external Java object interaction</li>
  <li>Support for a simple 2nd-order logic like representation</li>
</ol>
<h2>A Sample Rulebase</h2>
<p>The following code fragment shows a simple rulebase written in
Buchingae. This rulebase is used to test one of the OWL test cases W3C
has published. It's a test for OWL's functional property axiom. As you
can see, it's very URI friendly.
</p>
<pre class="code">01 prefix rdf = http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#;<br>02 prefix owl = http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#;<br>03 prefix xsd = http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#;<br>04 prefix rdfs = http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#;<br>05 prefix first = http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/FunctionalProperty/premises001#;<br>06 namespace is http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/FunctionalProperty/premises001#;<br>07 rulebase FunctionalPropertyTest1<br>08 {<br>09	fact Fact1 is owl:FunctionalProperty(prop);<br>10	fact Fact2 is prop(subject,object1);<br>11	fact Fact3 is prop(subject,object2);<br>12<br>13	rule FuncProp is if owl:FunctionalProperty(?p) and ?p(?x,?y)<br>14                          and ?p(?x,?z) and [?y != ?z]<br>15			 then owl:sameAs(?y,?z);<br>16 }</pre>
<p> Let's dissect. </p>
<p>Lines 01 ~ 05</p>
<p> The first part is a series of namespace prefix declarations. With
the keyword <span style="font-family: monospace;">prefix,</span> you
can declare namespace prefixes you're going to use in the rulebase.
Once you declare a namespace prefix, you can use the prefix to name any
knowledge element. For example, at line 09, you can see a prefix <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">owl</span> is used to name a predicate
symbol, <span style="font-family: monospace;">owl:FunctionalProperty</span>.
By the prefix declaration at line 02, this symbol is resolved into <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#FunctionalProperty</span>.
</p>
<p>Line 06</p>
<p> With a keyword namespace, you declare a base namespace of a
knowledge base. Every local name, which is without a namespace prefix,
is qualified by the base namespace. At line 07, you can see an
unqualified name <span style="font-family: monospace;">FunctionalPropertyTest1</span>.
By the base namespace, the name is resolved into <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/FunctionalProperty/premises001#FunctionalPropertyTest1</span>.
Base namespace declaration should not be omitted. </p>
<p>Line 07</p>
<p> The body of a rulebase begins with a keyword rulebase. You assign a
rulebase name with it. If you want to use a full URI to name a
rulebase, you can do it like this: </p>
<pre class="code">rulebase http://a.b.c/RuleBases#FunctionalPropertyTest1 { ... }</pre>
<p>Line 09 ~ 11</p>
<p> There're three fact assertions. The first one at line 09 is stated
like this: "By a fact named <span style="font-family: monospace;">Fact1</span>,
I assert that a constant named <span style="font-family: monospace;">prop</span>
is an <span style="font-family: monospace;">owl:FunctionalProperty</span>."
At line 10 and 11, there're two more facts asserted. <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">subject</span>, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">object1</span>, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">object2</span> are all constants, and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">prop</span> is a predicate symbol. You
can see in the example that the predicate symbol <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">prop</span> is used as a constant term
in <span style="font-family: monospace;">Fact1</span>. In Buchingae,
predicate symbols are treated similarily like other constants or
variables. Let's go into deeper with the rule <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">FuncProp</span> at line 13 ~ 15. </p>
<p>Line 13 ~15</p>
<p> The rule <span style="font-family: monospace;">FuncProp</span> is
a little bit complex one, and showcases some important aspects of
Buchingae. The keyword <span style="font-family: monospace;">rule</span>
is used to begin a new rule definition. The body of a rule is simply in
the form of <span style="font-style: italic;">if condition then
conclusion</span>. In <span style="font-family: monospace;">FuncProp</span>
rule, four predicates, or patterns in the sense of production rule, are
specified, and they are all joined by conjunction, so each and every
predicate should be true, or bound by some facts, for the containing
rule to be fired. Let's dissect the condition part. </p>
<p> The first predicate, <span style="font-family: monospace;">owl:FunctionalProperty(?p)</span>,
contains one variable term <span style="font-family: monospace;">?p</span>.
All the constants declared as <span style="font-family: monospace;">owl:FunctionalProperty</span>
will be bound to <span style="font-family: monospace;">?p</span>. </p>
<p> The second predicate, <span style="font-family: monospace;">?p(?x,?y)</span>,
contains three variable terms, <span style="font-family: monospace;">?p</span>,
<span style="font-family: monospace;">?x</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">?y</span>. You can use a variable term
as a predicate symbol. With this predicate, you're trying to find all
the facts which have two terms. Combined by a conjunction with the
first predicate, <span style="font-family: monospace;">?p</span> is
restricted to all the constants which happen to be <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">owl:FunctionalProperty</span>. </p>
<p> The fourth predicate, <span style="font-family: monospace;">[?x !=
?y]</span>, actually looks not like a predicate but an expression. But
it's really a predicate which tests inequality of the two terms, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">?x</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">?y</span>. The predicate becomes true
only if a constant bound to <span style="font-family: monospace;">?x</span>
is different from a constant bound to <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">?y</span>. There are six comparison
operators provided by Buchingae. They are: </p>
<ul>
  <li><code><span style="font-family: monospace;"> &gt;</span></code> :
greater than</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;"> &lt;</span> : less than</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;"> &gt;=</span> : greater
than or equals</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;"> &lt;=</span> : less than
or equals</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;"> =</span> ,<code> ==</code>:
equals <span style="font-style: italic;">(= and == are all accepted)</span><br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;"> !=</span> : not equals</li>
</ul>
<p> One thing to be reminded is that you have to embrace any
expressions with with brackets<span style="font-family: monospace;"
 class="codefrag"></span>. </p>
<h2>Basic Language Constructs</h2>
<h3>Constants and Variables</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>You specify variables by prepending an identifier with a question
mark. Some example variables are: <span style="font-family: monospace;">?x</span>,
<span style="font-family: monospace;">?var1</span>, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">?a_var</span>. </p>
<p>Constants are plain identifiers without a prepending question mark.
In Buchingae, there're seven data types for constants. Variables are
not
explicitly typed.</p>

<h3>Predicates</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>Predicate is an atomic knowledge representation element in
Buchingae. The predicate is composed of two parts. The first part is a
predicate symbol, and the second is a list of terms. The predicate
symbol can be a variable or a constant. If it's a constant, it should
be an object constant. Each term of a predicate can be a variable or a
constant. Any type of constant can come as a term. Here're some
examples of valid predicates: </p>
<table class="ForrestTable" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1">

  </tbody>
</table>
<p>An example of an invalid predicate: <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">"owl:John"(?p)</span>. As <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">"owl:John"</span> is a string
constant, not an object constant, it is an invalid predicate symbol.
All the predicate symbols should be a variable or an object constant. </p>
</div>
<h3>Connectives: Conjunction &amp; Disjunction</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>You can build sentences by connecting predicates with connectives.
There're two connectives in Buchingae. Two connectives are; <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">and</span> which denotes a conjunction
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">or</span> a disjunction. The
following is a simple statement with these two connectives.</p>
<pre class="code">family:hasFather(?x,?y) and famili:hasFather(?y,?z)<br>family:age(?x,20) or family:age(?x,25) and human:Man(?x)</pre>
<p>You can use braces to combine any subsentence like this:</p>
<pre class="code">(family:age(?x,20) or family:age(?x,25)) and human:Man(?x)</pre>
</div>
<h3>Negations: Weak &amp; Strong Negations</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>There're two kinds of negations in the world of logic. One is a
classical negation which is sometimes called strong negation, and the
other one is a negation as failure which is sometimes called weak
negation. Weak negation is based on closed-world assumption. Strong
negation is specified by a keyword neg, and weak negation is specified
by not. Negations can be attached only to predicates. Some usage
examples of negations are as follows: </p>
<pre class="code">if not Woman(?x) then Man(?x);<br>if neg Woman(?x) then Man(?x);<br>if Woman then neg Man(?x);</pre>
<p>Negation as failure cannot be used in the conclusion part of a rule,
as it is a test for non-existence of a specific fact. In contrast with
weak negation, strong negation in the condition part is a test for
existence of a strongly negated fact. For example, the second rule of
the examples above fires only when one or more facts of the form neg
Woman(constant) are explicitly asserted in the knowledge base. The
third rule shows a case of using strong negation in the conclusion part
of a rule. </p>
<p>Rule processors should be equipped with internal semantics for
processing strong negation and weak negation.</p>
</div>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>As in Java, multi-line C-style comments and one-line C++ style
comments are all allowed in Buchingae, as showcased in the following
example.</p>
<pre class="code">/*<br>** A rulebase for determining a service grade for a customer.<br>** Written by Buch.<br>*/<br>rulebase ServiceGrade<br>{<br>	// This is simply a rule.<br>	fact Fact1 is .....;<br>	// This is another...<br>	fact Fact2 is .....;<br>	// etc...<br>}</pre>
</div>
<h2>Knowledge Elements</h2>
<h3>Fact</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>Fact is the most basic knowledge element in Buchingae. With fact,
you assert that something is true. The rough syntax of specifying a
fact is as follows: </p>
<pre class="code">fact factID is predicate-symbol[(constant-term {,constant-term})];</pre>
<p>factID is a local name pointing to a defined fact. The body of a
fact is a predicate, which is composed of only constant predicate
symbol and constant terms. You may define a fact which has no terms. A
knowledge element definition is ended by a semicolon.</p>
<p>As a side note, bracket symbols in the above example represent a
optional part, and braces a repeated part.</p>
</div>
<h3>Rule</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>A typical rule definition structure is as follows:</p>
<pre class="code">rule ruleID is if condition-part then conclusion-part;</pre>
<p>In the condition-part, you specify all the conditional elements that
should be true to make the rule fire. In the conclusion-part, some new
knowledge elements entailed by the condition-part. A syntax for the
condition-part is as follows:</p>
<pre class="code">literal {(and | or) literal}</pre>
<p>A literal is a predicate in one of the following three forms:</p>
<pre class="code"><br>predicate	--- (1)<br>not predicate	--- (2)<br>neg predicate	--- (3)</pre>
<p>(1) is a positive literal, (2) a weakly negated literal or a
negation-as-failure negated literal and (3) a strongly negated literal.</p>
<p>The structure of the conclusion-part is as follows:</p>
<pre class="code">(predicate | neg predicate) {and (predicate | neg predicate)}</pre>
<p>Weak negation and disjunctive connectives("or") cannot be used in
the conclusion part.</p>
<h4>Rule Priority</h4>
<p>A rule can be assigned a priority value. The priority value is any
negative or positive integer. The default semantic for the priority
value is that the bigger priority value implicates higher priority of
rule firing. The following example rule is assigned a priority value of
20.</p>
<pre class="code">rule BuchRules(20) is if ..... then ....;</pre>
</div>
<h3>Class</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>You can define a class with Buchingae. The class definition
construct is as follows:</p>
<pre class="code">class classID [inherits classID {, classID}];</pre>
<p>inherits keyword is used to specify super classes of a defined
class. Unlike usual object-oriented languages, the class definition in
Buchingae is simply introducing a new class name and listing super
classes. The properties of a class is defined separately. This is the
same way of defining structured knowledge as in ontology, RDF and
entity-relationship schema etc.</p>
<p>Here's a sample class definition.</p>
<pre class="code">class Human inherits Animal;</pre>
</div>
<h3>Property</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>Properties are defined separately from classes, and relationships
with classes are specified in each property definition. Here's the
structure of property definition construct:</p>
<pre class="code">property propertyID for classID {,classID} is datatypeID;</pre>
<p>The classIDs following the keyword for are members of the domain of
a defined property. In effect, each domain class has the property as
one of its members. datatypeID is the range of the property, which
means that the property has a value of type datatypeID. datatypeID
should be one of the IDs of any RDFS classes, OWL classes or XML schema
datatypes.</p>
<p>Here's a sample property definition.</p>
<pre class="code">property age for Human is xsd:positiveInteger;</pre>
</div>
<h3>Individual</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>Class and property definitions constitute a kind of schema. With the
definitions, you can populate instances of classes. In Buchingae, you
create instances with a keyword individual. The structure of individual
creation is as follows:</p>
<pre class="code">individual individualID is classID [and propertyID = value {, propertyID = value};</pre>
<p>classID in this case specifies the type of a created individual.
Usually, it should be one of RDFS classes or OWL classes. The optional
part which begins with a keyword and is where property values are
assigned. The properties should have the specified classID as one of
its domain classes. The following is a sample individual definition.</p>
<pre class="code">individual John is Person and age = 20, name = "John Travolta", birthdate = 2005-10-30;</pre>
<p>An individual is internally a structured fact, which is a structured
collection of facts. The above example can be rewritten as follows:</p>
<pre class="code">fact John1 is Person(John);<br>fact John2 is age(John,20);<br>fact John3 is name(John,"John Travolta");</pre>
<p>You may find realizing this equivalance between a set of facts and
an individual to be useful when you write rulebases to perform
reasoning over some object-oriented knowledge bases like web ontologies
or RDF statements.</p>
</div>
<h3>Function</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>In Buchingae, there's no syntax for defining functions. But you may
call built-in functions. There're saveral built-in functions
defined in Buchingae for arithmetic, comparation, etc. For comparation,
these are six builtin functions: lessThan(&lt;),
lessThanOrEquals(&lt;=), equals(=),
notEquals(!=), greaterThan(&gt;), greaterThanOrEquals(&gt;=). These
functions can be used in a function form or in an expression form. The
following two examples are semantically the same.</p>
<pre class="code">rule r1 is if some(?x) and some(?y) and test(greaterThan(?x,?y)) then ...<br>rule r2 is if some(?x) and some(?y) and [?x &lt; ?y] then ...</pre>
<p><code>test</code> is an internal predicate used to call boolean
functions. A
boolean function used as a term of test should be true to make test
predicate true. test is usually not exposed to Buchingae programmers,
but it can be used explicitly like the example above.</p>
<p>As for arithmetic operators, there're 5 operators supported: +, -,
/, *, %. The meaning of each operator should be obvious. Some example
usages are shown below.<br>
</p>
<p><code>rule r1 is if some(?x) and some(?y) and checkIt([?x+(?y-1)*2])
then conclude([?x+?y]);<br>
rule r2 is if some(?x) and some(?y) and [?x-(?y+1)/(?y-1) &lt; 0] then
conclude(?x,[?y+1]);<br>
rule r3 is if some(?x) and some(?y) then conclude([1/2]);<br>
</code></p>
<p>Please be sure to embrace expressions with brackets - <code>[]</code>.<br>
</p>
</div>
<h2>Procedural Attachment: Calling Java Objects from Rules</h2>
<p>Buchingae provides a convenient and simple procedural attachment
mechanism. It's possible to call Java object's reader methods at the
antecedent part of rules, and modifier methods at the conclusion part.
The following code is a simple example of calling a Java object's
method in a Buchingae rule.<br>
</p>
<pre class="code">prefix string = java://java.lang/String#;<br>rule CallJava01 is if string#length(?x,?l) and [?l &lt; 10] then ShortString(?x);</pre>
&lt;&gt;The URI with a scheme <span style="font-family: monospace;"
 class="codefrag">java</span><span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span>in
the antecedent part of the rule <span style="font-family: monospace;"
 class="codefrag">CallJava01</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">
</span>references a Java object's method. As can be seen, the path part
of the URI is the full package name of the Java class, and the fragment
ID is the name of a method to be called. The first term, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;" class="codefrag">?x</span> of the <span
 class="codefrag">length</span> predicate is bound to <span
 style="font-family: monospace;" class="codefrag">java.lang.String</span>
objects which is loaded in to the Bossam's working memory. The result
of the method call is bound to the second term of the predicate, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;" class="codefrag">?l</span> in the
example rule. By replacing the method name with a reserved word <span
 style="font-family: monospace;" class="codefrag">Class</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">,</span> one can bind objects of a
specific Java class type to a variable. For example, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;" class="codefrag">java://etri.bossam/Run#Class(?x)</span>
binds to <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="codefrag">?x</span>
all the objects existing in the inference context with the type <span
 style="font-family: monospace;" class="codefrag">etri.bossam.Run</span>.
<p>When initiating a reasoning session using Bossam engine API, Java
objects which are to be used for reasoning should be sent to the engine
by putting the objects in an inference context object and passing it to
the engine.<br>
</p>
Bossam's procedural attachment mechanism is very intuitive and general.
The mechanism can be easily extended to other kinds of object systems
by using different URI protocol schemes. For example, a scheme "<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">soap</span>" can be used to attach
predicates to the objects accessible via SOAP messaging. Also, if only
getter methods with no input parameters are used in the antecedent
part, it would be possible to divide the literal space of OWL and
assign external objects to the space. In that way, OWL semantics can be
extended to account for external objects.

<p>Many thanks should go to Terence Parr, who developed ANTLR. With
ANTLR, it was a great fun to build a parser for Buchingae. Without
ANTLR, it must have been much harder to build a parser for Buchingae.
You can get ANTLR from http://antlr.org.<br>
